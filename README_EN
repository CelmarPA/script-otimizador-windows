# 🛠️ System Optimizer (Windows)

A Batch (.bat) script to optimize Windows performance, clean temporary files, manage background apps, configure power plan, test performance, and automatically update all installed software via Winget.

## Features
- Disables Windows services that may reduce performance (SysMain, WinSAT)
- Automatically sets power plan to High Performance
- Cleans user and system temporary files
- Manages background apps (enable/disable)
- Tests PC performance using WinSAT
- Automatically updates all programs installed via Winget
- Generates a detailed log of updates (update_log.txt)
- Full optimization option that runs all functions together

## How It Works
- Batch (.bat) script running with administrative privileges
- Uses cmd.exe and PowerShell for specific tasks:
  - sc and taskkill for Windows services
  - powercfg for configuring power plan
  - reg add for enabling/disabling background apps
  - winget for updating software
- Silent function versions (_silent) allow full optimization without unnecessary prompts
- Automatically generates a log file for updates

## Getting Started
1. Download the file otimizador.bat
2. Right-click → Run as administrator

## Menu Options
1 - Disable SysMain
2 - Disable WinSAT

4 - Clean temporary files

## Notes
- Recommended for Windows 10/11
- Winget must be installed for the update option to work correctly
- Update log file is saved in the same directory as the script (update_log.txt)
- Running as administrator is recommended to avoid permission errors
